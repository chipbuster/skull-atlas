Volume Rover Scripts
====================

These scripts provide easy wrappers to access VolumeRover functionality.

Set the appropriate variables in `config.sh`, then run the scripts. Documentation
is currently limited to comments inside the scripts.

BE CAREFUL! These scripts have *not* been checked for safe behavior if silly
(or nonexistent) arguments are passed!
